# Collatz
Demonstration of the Collatz Conjecture

  Take any positive integer. If the number is even divide it by 2. If not then multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue to do so for 
each number you get. The Collatz Conjecture states no matter which number you pick this process will reach 1 eventually, meaning 
that there are no sequences that go to infinity. As the name suggests, this is only a conjecture therefore hasn't been proven yet.

  The code just puts out the integers in a given range. It then applies the process to every one of them and displays the results
  simultaneously. 
  
  You can adjust the range of values by playing with row and col variables.
